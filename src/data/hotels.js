      "Hi Guest! Hope you will have an awesome stay at our place. Aside from keeping things clean and not screaming after midnight, we don't have many rules. Here are however the things you should pay attention to: 1 - Whenever you leave the house, please make sure the windows and back door are closed and locked. 2 - The front door can be a bit hard to shut so make sure to give it the extra push or pull so that it locks properly. 3 - There is a washer and dryer downstairs in the basement, which you can access through the living room. The basement light switches are on the pillar, situated at the bottom of the stairs on the left.  Our linen closet is filled with extra blankets and bed sheets. it is in the beige closet at the bottom of the basement stairs. 4 - If you use the microwave at the same time as the toaster or electric kettle, it will blow a fuse so try to remember not to do it. If it happens, no big deal, it can be switched back on through the electric panel in the basement. Voilà ! i",
